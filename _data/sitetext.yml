          I follow the Reggio Emilia approach which supports
          children's development by providing open-ended materials and
          toys that help children learn while they have fun
          exploring. I include music time in the schedule where I play
          the piano and invite the children to get musical instruments
          and sing along with me. I value happiness, equity, empathy,
          emotional regulation and love so I help children learn those
          values while they interact with their peers.

          We spend at least two hours per day, morning and afternoon,
          outside of the house. The yard is equipped with climbing
          structures, swings, slides, push cars, bikes, balls, a play
          house with a play kitchen, where children can develop their
          motor skills and engage in dramatic play.
